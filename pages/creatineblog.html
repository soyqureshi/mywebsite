                <p>Creatine is formed of three amino acids: L-arginine, glycine, and L-methionine. It makes up about one
                    per cent of the total volume of human blood. Creatine is a nitrogenous organic acid that helps
                    supply energy to cells throughout the body, particularly muscle cells. (Nordqvist, 2017). Chemically
                    speaking, it shares many similarities with amino acids. Your body can produce it from the amino
                    acids glycine and arginine.</p>

                <p>About 95% of your body's creatine is stored in muscles in the form of phosphocreatine. The other 5%
                    is found in your brain, kidneys and liver. When you supplement, you increase your stores of
                    phosphocreatine. This is a form of stored energy in the cells, as it helps your body produce more of
                    a high-energy molecule called ATP. ATP is often called the body's energy currency. When you have
                    more ATP, your body can perform better during exercise. The most common and well-researched
                    supplement form is called creatine monohydrate (Pubmed.gov).</p><br>


                <h2>How Does It Works?</h2>

                <p>Creatine can improve health and athletic performance in several ways. In high-intensity exercise, its
                    primary role is to increase the phosphocreatine stores in your muscles. The additional stores can
                    then be used to produce more ATP, which is the key energy source for heavy lifting and
                    high-intensity exercise.</p>

                <p>Creatine also helps you gain muscle in the following ways:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Boosted workload: Enables more total work or volume in a single training session, which is a key
                        factor in long-term muscle growth.</li>
                    <li>Improved cell signalling: Can increase satellite cell signalling, which aids muscle repair and
                        new muscle growth.</li>
                    <li>Raised anabolic hormones: Studies note a rise in hormones, such as IGF-1, after taking creatine.
                    </li>
                    <li> Increased cell hydration: Lifts water content within your muscle cells, which causes a cell
                        volumization effect that may play a role in muscle growth.</li>
                    <li>Reduced protein breakdown: May increase total muscle mass by reducing muscle breakdown.</li>
                    <li>Lower myostatin levels: Elevated levels of the protein myostatin can slow or totally inhibit new
                        muscle growth. Supplementing with creatine can reduce these levels, increasing growth potential.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h2>Dosage Instructions</h2>

                <p>Many people who supplement start with a loading phase, which leads to a rapid increase in muscle
                    stores of creatine.<br>
                    To load with creatine, take 20 grams per day for 5–7 days. This should be split into four 5-gram
                    servings throughout the day.<br>
                    Absorption may be slightly improved with a carb- or protein-based meal due to the related release of
                    insulin.<br>
                    Following the loading period, take 3–5 grams per day to maintain high levels within your muscles. As
                    there is no benefit to cycling creatine, you can stick with this dosage for a long time.<br>
                    If you choose not to do the loading phase, you can simply consume 3–5 grams per day. However, it may
                    take 3–4 weeks to maximize your stores.<br>
                    Since creatine pulls water into your muscle cells, it is advisable to take it with a glass of water
                    and stay well hydrated throughout the day.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>Interactions</h2>

                <p>In high doses, it is "possibly safe." It is expected that it could affect the liver, kidneys, or
                    heart, although these effects have not been proven. (Nordqvist, 2017)
                    Other possible effects include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>stomach pain</li>
                    <li> nausea</li>
                    <li>muscle cramping</li>
                    <li>diarrhea</li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    A number of energy drinks now combine creatine with caffeine and ephedra. There is some concern that
                    this could have serious adverse effects, after one athlete experienced a stroke.<br>

                    Creatine affects water levels in the body. Taking creatine with diuretics may lead to
                    dehydration.<br>

                    Combining creatine with any drug that affects the kidneys is not recommended. Taking it with
                    probenecid, a treatment for gout, may also increase the risk of kidney damage.<br><br>
